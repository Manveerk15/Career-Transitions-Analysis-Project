# 📊 Career Transitions Analysis Project

A real-world inspired analytics project exploring global career transitions using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**. The project analyzes transition patterns, salary shifts, job satisfaction, reasons and barriers for switching careers, and training impacts — all modeled with relational, messy data to simulate a real business environment.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Identify patterns in career transitions by role, industry, and demographics.
- Measure salary growth, training effectiveness, and job satisfaction before/after transitions.
- Explore key reasons and barriers to switching careers using ranked metrics.
- Build interactive dashboards and professional reports with reusable SQL components.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

This project is based on **real-world career change research**, structured into simulated but messy datasets for hands-on analysis. Data is drawn and modeled from sources like:

- HiringLab (Indeed), LinkedIn Pulse
- U.S. Department of Labor dashboards
- Novoresume, Apollo Technical, CareerShifters
- UQ Study, BrainManager, and more

### Tables in the Project

| Table                | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `tblDemographics`    | Participant profile (age, gender, education, country, previous industry) |
| `tblTransitions`     | Each career move (from → to role/industry, time, date) |
| `tblIncome_History`  | Salary before/after transition, % increase |
| `tblSatisfaction`    | Job satisfaction scores before/after |
| `tblTrainings_Certs` | Training, hours, provider, certification earned |
| `tblBarriers`        | Barriers faced, severity, barrier text |
| `tblReasons`         | Reason types, reason comment |

All tables are normalized and connected via `person_id` and `transition_id`.

## 🧼 Data Cleaning (Excel)

All source tables were intentionally structured to mimic real-world data challenges, including inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues — allowing for practical demonstration of data cleaning and transformation skills.

Key cleaning steps included:

- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing country, industry, and role naming
- Fixing inconsistent text cases (UPPER vs lower)
- Tracking changes in a cleaning log template
